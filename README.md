# REACT BASIC TEMPLATE

This is a basic template for react, I create it for myself to learn React hohoho

# What is inside this?

1. A **package-lock.json** 
2. A **package.json**
3. A folder names **src**
*In folder **src**, we have:*
*3.1 An App.js File, this will export a module that is created by us*
*3.2 An index.js File, this will be the File that is rendered and exported to the screen for the viewers.*
*3.3 A style.css to edit css for component :ƒê it seems that in React using **className** is common*
4. A **.gitignore** File. I'm sure that you do not want to see this fucking node-modules shit that is really heavy in your repo :D 
5. A **public** folder that contains **index.html** with *root* tag to displays components that is rendered from React.

#And Finally, wish me luck
